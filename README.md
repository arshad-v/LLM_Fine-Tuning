# HealChat - Heal your Soul <br>
A mental health chatbot, which specialises in working with individuals who have experienced trauma, depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses. Share your thoughts and concerns & it will try it's best
to heal you.

## About The Project

Our aim was to create a mental health chatbot, for answering queries related to preserving mental health.
<br><br>
A pre-trained Large Language Model called TinyLlama was used as the base model for our chatbot.

<br>
For that the path we journeyed are:
<ul>
  <li>
    Created a dataset that contains over 350 questions and answers that relate to mental health.
  </li>
  <li>
    Loaded the base model for the purpose of fine tuning.
  </li>
  <li>
    The model was fine tuned using the above mention dataset, for 30 epochs
  </li>
</ul>

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG, an AI framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLMs' generative process. Used for improving the quality of LLM-generated responses by grounding the model on external sources of knowledge to supplement the LLMâ€™s internal representation of information.

## Getting Started

The chatbot was developed using transfer learning techniques by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. The fine-tuning was performed on Google Colab utilizing a T4 GPU for accelerated training.

## Features
* Customized Responses: Tailored responses based on a dataset designed to address a wide range of mental health topics. 
* Supportive Interactions: Engages users in a supportive and non-judgmental manner.
* Resource Recommendations: Provides users with relevant resources and coping strategies.

## Limitations
* Resource Limitations: Limited computational resources and low dataset volume.
* Data Handling: Ensuring the dataset was comprehensive and representative of diverse mental health issues while maintaining data privacy and ethical standards.
* Recurring response: Due to limited data and inability to fine-tune the model with a large number of epochs, leads to a never ending response
* Improper response: A rare chance to receive an incorrect response from the bot.

## Solutions
* Increase the size of the dataset
* Fine tune the model with a large number of epochs
* By using RAG, we were able to get better responses from the model.
